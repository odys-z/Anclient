Project for anclient.js. Previously name jclient which is deprecated for package
name conflicting.

There are two version of webpack config.

## quick start (only EasyUI version currently)

*Note*:

*This doc is old. A newer version using docker is coming ...*

Anclient.js currently only has the [EasyUI](www.jeasyui.com) version working.
The client template is provided as a project template for client.

To get kick started,

1. [download ansample-easui template](https://github.com/odys-z/jclient/blob/master/js/test/ansample-easyui.zip)

2. unpack and check server url.

In <upacked-dir>/easyui/app-common/jsample-easyui.js/

```
    jconsts = {
        ...
        serv: 'http://localhost:8080/jsample',
    }
```
where the url is the root path to your semantic.jserv server.

3. open easyui/login.html.

All configuration should working.

Also some vue client can be used as example:

TODO: docs ...

~~~
    npm i anclient
~~~

Check test/vue/index.html and test/vue/home.html
