/**
 * The contract between string.xml items and app constants.
 *
 * <h3>How is it working</h3>
 * 1. App main Activity load Prefkeys' members from string.xml;<br>
 * 2. AlbumContext, the singlton, use these keys to receive values from persisted preference.
 * <h3>Details</h3>
 * In android, it's said it's wrong to use constants of code in resource.
 * <p>Prefkeys is used as a bridge for finding preferences with a string constant as the key.
 * This string value is configured in string.xml, for preference's layout key.</p>
 * <p>However, Albumtier is independent of package resource, but needing persisted value from
 * shared preferences. Those preference key can only be provided from package resource.</p>
